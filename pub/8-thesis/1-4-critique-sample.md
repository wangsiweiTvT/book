在写作之前，我们先批判性地读一篇学长写过的论文。

阅读、分析和批判一篇已经完成的论文，能够给你提供真实的例子，说明这样一篇论文是可以完成的：你的笔记、研究日志、写作片段、图片、一手材料、数据集，是确实可以变成一篇论文的。它能给你一种感觉，知道一篇论文的流（flow）是怎样的。

在读这篇论文时，考虑它的假设、描述方式的选择、证据的使用方法、如何在一个更大的理论框架中使用这些证据的、中心论点、子论点、它们的相关性、论文的真实内容。

分析上述内容时，记笔记，记下它是如何完成这些工作的。思考：我能模仿他做得好的方面吗？我要怎样避免我发现的这篇论文的陷阱（pitfall）？我要如何建立我的论文所处的更大的谜题和问题的上下文（situate your thesis in the context of a larger set of puzzles and questions?）

下面是哈佛政府学院和历史系的写作指南中，给出的阅读和分析一篇范文的意义和方法。

## 政府学院指南

Reading and analyzing a sample thesis appropriate to your subfield. Reading and critiquing a completed senior thesis is useful for several reasons.

First, it provides real evidence that the task can actually be completed. Your pages of notes, journal entries, document chunks, photocopies, primary sources, and datasets can become an actual thesis. Second, the sample gives a feel for the distinct flow of a thesis.

The sample thesis you receive will by no means be perfect; it will be indicative of solid, meritorious performance. It can serve as a model for your own research and writing, giving you an idea of something to aspire toward. The sample thesis that you read, however, is not an ideal to be copied—the style, organization, approach, and tone may not be appropriate for your own work, and you should make decisions about these matters in consultation with your thesis adviser.

When you read a thesis, whether it’s the sample thesis or one of the others that you’ve located, consider the following questions:

• What assumptions does the writer make about the project?
• What choices does the writer make in presenting the research?
• How does the writer use the evidence?
• How does the writer situate the evidence in a larger body of theory?
• What is the central argument? What are the sub-arguments? How are they interrelated?
• What is the thesis really about?

Take notes as you read and analyze the theses. As your own thesis nears completion, you will find it helpful to look back on these notes with the following questions in mind:

1. Did you emulate the strengths you appreciated?
2. Did you avoid the pitfalls you identified?
3. How did you situate your thesis (in the context of a larger set of puzzles and questions)?

Reminding yourself how you responded to a completed thesis will heighten your awareness of how readers will respond to your own thesis.

## 历史学院指南

On the following pages, you will find a senior thesis written by Bicky David ’08（范文在整个指南的PDF中，链接见文后）. Reading a completed senior thesis is a useful exercise as you embark on your own project for several reasons. First, it proves that it can be done; just like Bicky’s, your pages of notes and piles of photocopies can become a senior thesis. Second, the exercise gives you a feel for the distinctive flow of a thesis, which is longer than a scholarly article (or Research Seminar paper!) but much shorter than a dissertation or book.

The sample thesis included in this handbook is by no means “perfect”; however, it does represent strong honors work that can serve as a model for your research and writing in many ways. While there are many impressive aspects of this thesis, do not assume that Bicky’s style, organization, or approach is necessarily appropriate for your thesis. You should make decisions about your approach after considering the goals of your project and consulting with your adviser.

As you read the sample thesis, pay attention to its overall structure and consider some of the following questions:

• What is her central argument? What are the necessary sub-arguments?
• What assumptions does Bicky make about her subject?
• What choices of emphasis does Bicky make in presenting her research?
• How does she use her evidence? How does she cite sources?
• How does she situate her argument within a larger historiography?
• What process do you think Bicky went through to arrive at this final product?
• What kind of history has she written?
• What is the thesis really about? What is the subject?

Once you have read Bicky’s work and thought about the questions above, consider the strengths and weaknesses of this thesis. Also, ask yourself if the work fits your expectations of a senior thesis. Why or why not?

Use the ample margin space to take notes as you read and reflect on Bicky’s thesis. As your own thesis nears completion in the spring, you will find it helpful to look back on these notes. Ask yourself:

• Did you emulate the strengths you appreciated?
• Did you avoid the pitfalls you identified?
• What assumptions and choices did you make?
• Is the argument in your introduction the same as in your conclusion, and sustained through your chapters?

Reminding yourself of how you responded to a completed thesis will heighten your sensitivity to how readers will understand your year-long project when they evaluate your final product.
