哈佛的学生杂志 Crimson 内容多样，是学生写的，风格很有意思。

比如 MIREYA SÁNCHEZ-MAES 同学的专栏 [网页链接](https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1217647/Mireya__S%C3%A1nchez-Maes/)，很有趣：

Oh my Gawd I Got a Bee

BY MIREYA SÁNCHEZ-MAES • APRIL 27, 2022

If you worked as hard as you possibly can and earned a Bee, then congrats! You should feel proud of your personal growth and hard work. Conversely, if you got a 4.0 GPA, but didn’t learn anything or cheated your way into it, then the accomplishment is empty. True learning is about personal growth, and grades can be misleading.
