---

联合国教科文组织 UNESCO 的面向学生 AI 能力的框架。这个框架包括 5 个方面：Mindset、Ethics、基础、技术、解决问题。每个方面包括 3 个层次：理解、应用、创造。

“Children learn best when they are actively engaged in constructing something that has
personal meaning to them.”
	        – Seymour Papert

第一个方面：Human-centred mindset

Understand: Critical Reflections on AI
- Critically discusses benefits, limitations, and risks of AI
- Gradually builds and expresses an understanding of human rights, social justice, inclusion, equity…
- Describes the connections between technology and social change

Apply: Safe and Responsible Use
- Develops values on personal usage of AI based on trade-offs
- Takes action to protect personal privacy and security
- Practices safe use of AI
- Identifies risks to human rights, human dignity, equity & inclusion, bias amplification…

Create: Self-actualization in the AI Era- Defines examples of AI in everyday life
- Pursues personal fulfillment in the AI era
- Develops a growth mindset, resilience and persistence
- Develops and defends views on long-term impact of AI on society

第二个方面：Ethics of AI

Understand: Human Agency
- Recognizes AI as human-led
- Understands the critical steps of AI development
- Describes ethical challenges that may arise in AI (bias, privacy, security, transparency, explainability…)

Apply: Ethics by Design
- Assesses the purpose of AI products beyond what is explicitly stated
- Communicates the benefits and potential ethical challenges of AI products engaged
- Explains how the decisions of AI creators impact system outcomes
- Proposes (or implements) modifications to address ethical concerns

Create: AI Citizenship- Understands ethical principles linked to AI: do-no-harm, safety and security, fairness, non-discrimination, the right to privacy, data protection, human oversight and determination, transparency, explainability
- Pursues ways to reduce the environmental costs of AI
- Reflects on existing inequities in developing AI, and root causes
- Advocates for ethical and responsible AI use in society
- Contributes to the co-creation of human- centred and inclusive societies

第三个方面：AI Foundations

Understand: Data, Algorithms, and Models
- Understands how data is collected, processed, and used
- Understands the principles of data ownership & privacy
- Understands the goals, benefits, and limitations of modeling data
- Understands sources of bias (human, data, algorithmic)

Apply: Programming and Data Analysis
- Constructs a database, and performs common operations on it
- Executes pre-processing techniques to ensure robust and fair data
- Analyzes data through models to extract meaning
- Uses programming skills to implement basic algorithms and models

Create: Models and Visual Representations- Describes basic functions and algorithms
- Creates visual representations of data using appropriate techniques
- Creates abstractions of AI systems using flowcharts, diagrams and pseudocode
- Evaluates existing algorithms and models for specific use cases

第四个方面：AI skills

Understand: AI Techniques and Applications

- Understands how AI techniques are applied across categories of AI technologies and domains
- Based on real use cases, evaluates accessibility and the linguistic / cultural diversity of AI
- Describes the challenge of explainability for different types of algorithms and models

Apply: Practical AI Skills
- Uses open-source AI tools and programming libraries
- Debugs pre-existing AI systems
- Designs and implements testing strategies for AI systems
- Implements basic AI techniques for specific applications

Create: Creating AI Products- Knows key AI techniques
- Improves existing open source AI models to fit specific goals
- Evaluates existing AI models for specific problem needs (e.g. across culture or language)
- Skillfully develops AI products using multiple AI tools to solve problems
- Assesses the limitations and risks of personal and peer AI creations

第五个方面：AI for Problem Solving

Understand: Problem Scoping

- Determines which problems can be solved using AI from a technical perspective
- Determines which problems should/n't be solved using AI from a logical, ethical, or cultural perspective

Apply: Co-design
- Effectively collaborates with peers to plan and design AI projects
- Assesses different AI models against identified problem statements and available inputs
- Assesses the availability of ethical and appropriate data
- Chooses between various possible solutions for the best approach
- Effectively communicates the purpose, use cases and limitations of planned AI projects

Create: Co-creation and Feedback Loops- Identifies problems to support human rights
- Implements AI solutions to solve a problem in collaboration with others
- Provides and receives constructive feedback from peers and community
- Assesses the process from design thinking or other problem-solving methodologies
